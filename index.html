	<p> Hello, my name is Kain Gutierrez. I'm 18 years old and I'm a student at ASU. Some of my hobbies include journaling and cooking. I have three journals; 
	one of which is for my dreams. The other two are for venting about my personal life. Every morning, I cook myself two eggs with some salsa and cheese. I really enjoy living a quiet life, where I get to sleep peacefully every night. I don't exercise much, but I am currently addicted to jump roping. Once I'm done with a workout, I usually spend the rest of the day eating and doing homework. I also really like animals. I have a cat and a dog and I love both of them.
